This is the original Haskell implementation for "Parsing With Derivatives" by
Might, Darais and Spiewak (ICFP 2011).

The entire implementation is in src/DerParser.hs.

See src/DerParser/Tests.hs for tests and example parsers.

This implementation has not been maintained since early 2010, and is intended
to serve as a reference only.
